    I know absolutely nothing about parenting. Seriously, I'm not an expert.
  I've only learned a few things and I wanted to make notes for my future self
  and anyone else who is interested. Take all this information with a grain of
  salt, it may or may not be useful, but I hope it is.

    A lot of the advice you'll find here came from close friends and relatives.
  It is not new information, only things that I constantly asked other people!
  I thought this would be nice to pass along to other new dads when asked.
