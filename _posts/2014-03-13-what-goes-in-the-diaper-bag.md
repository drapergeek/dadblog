title: "What Goes in the Diaper Bag?"
category: posts
---

This post is only partially written, I just need something to start off a post
with!

Basic Essentials for the baby:

* Diapers
* Wipes
* Swaddling blanket
* Changing pad
* Toy

Things I've Found Handy:

* Spare USB battery and appropriate cable for you phone - this can come in handy
  when you're stuck somewhere for an extended amount of time
* Multitool - believe me, you will use this
* Deck of cards - you will get stuck somewhere at some point, bored
